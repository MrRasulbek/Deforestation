        </h1>
        <p class="second-seciton_text">Deforestation, clearance,
          clearcutting, or clearing is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land that is then converted to
          non-forest use. Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms, ranches, or urban use. The most
          concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests. About 31% of Earth's land surface is covered by
          forests.

              Trees and plants are important for our
              world and life because they
              give oxygin with what we are
              alive and make our earth look
              like very beatiful. Every day we use resources of trees and for this reason we should be more grateful for
              them and take care of them with watering and planting new ones</p><a href="./info-1.html"

            <p class="third-section_text">If we compare
              the forests of the past and
              now we will witness the
              difference,forests which once
              had a big trees, now have
              shortage of plants. In the prehistoric years, air was reasonbly clear and fresh because of trees but now
              there is shortage of trees which is resulting fresh air to become rare. we should love nature and protect
              trees</p><a href="./info-2.html" class="third-section_link">Further information<i

              Deforestation</h2>

              greatest cause of
              deforestation among other ones
              like building, using for
              heating, making paper,
              constructing bulidings in
              place of forests. We as human being can stop causes of deforestation
